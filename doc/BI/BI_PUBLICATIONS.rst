**IMPACT OF MULTI-THRESHOLDS AND VECTOR CORRECTION FOR TRACKING PRECIPITATING SYSTEMS OVER THE AMAZON BASIN**

**Abstract:** Different algorithms for forecasting and tracking meteorological systems have been developed over the years. Many of them are used to study 
cloud propagation, precipitation and lightning for nowcasting. Therefore, it is necessary to define carefully the parameters (e.g., intensity 
thresholds and minimum size) that impact tracking of these variables. In order to represent the physical aspects of rain propagation over the Amazon 
region, several methods of correction and displacement detection were studied. Different parameters were used to validate the methods based on the 
extrapolated rain cell. A probability detection of 78.4% and 68.6% was achieved for 20 dBZ thresholds during the wet and dry season, respectively. 
However, the POD decreases for higher reflectivity thresholds. The results for corrections by Inner Nuclei showed that embedded convection can dictate 
the propagation of rain cells. Split and merge corrections performed well; however, they applied only to a few cases. Corrections performed better 
for precipitating systems with larger areas and longer duration. The correction methods showed similar skills for both seasons. Which shows that 
they are able to monitor rain cells throughout the year. The automated combination of different methods for the 20 dBZ threshold proved to be the 
best choice for tracking rainfall in the Amazon region.
